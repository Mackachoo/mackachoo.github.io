<h1>Dan Buxton</h1>

<p>
    I am a driven and creative individual with a passion for Physics, Computer
    Science, and Mathematics. I have a strong ability to learn and adapt
    quickly, as well as work independently or as part of a team. I am looking
    for a challenging position in the field of technology, both in software and
    hardware, where I can use my skills to make a significant and creative
    contribution.
