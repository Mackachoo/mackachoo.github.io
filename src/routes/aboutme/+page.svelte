<p>
    I hope you are doing well? I am extremely interested in this role and I have
    a solid background in Computer Science and Physics that I believe will make
    me perfect for it. I have successfully built websites using Python and
    Django with React and Svelte as the front end. I've also used Python heavily
    for data analysis, physics simulations and other personal projects. I have
    experience with Flutter, Java, C and MIPS and bring a strong understanding
    of hardware and networking.

    Over the years I've been in all levels of project management and
    collaboration, which make me well-prepared for working with cross-functional
    teams and contributing to in dynamic environments. I hold a Master's degree
    in Computational Physics and I am genuinely passionate about technology and
    new ways of using it help people.
