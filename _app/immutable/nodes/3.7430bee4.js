I am extremely interested in this role
            and I have a solid background in Computer Science and Physics that I
            believe will make me perfect for it. I have successfully built
            websites using Python and Django with React and Svelte as the front
            end. I&#39;ve also used Python heavily for data analysis, physics
            simulations and other personal projects. I have experience with
            Flutter, Java, C and MIPS and bring a strong understanding of
            hardware and networking.</p> <br/> <p>Over the years I&#39;ve been in all levels of project management and
            collaboration, which make me well-prepared for working with
            cross-functional teams and contributing to in dynamic environments.
            I hold a Master&#39;s degree in Computational Physics and I am genuinely
            passionate about technology and new ways of using it help people.</p></div> <img src="${_}" alt="Graduation" class="image mx-10 mt-2 h-[60vh]"/>`,n,t,d="Education and Qualifications";return{c(){e=u("div"),e.innerHTML=i,n=g(),t=u("h2"),t.textContent=d,this.h()},l(a){e=h(a,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(e)!=="svelte-1yu7ykq"&&(e.innerHTML=i),n=y(a),t=h(a,"H2",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(t)!=="svelte-n91u73"&&(t.textContent=d),this.h()},h(){p(e,"class","flex my-5"),p(t,"class","border-tan border-b-4 mb-5")},m(a,o){l(a,e,o),l(a,n,o),l(a,t,o)},p:r,i:r,o:r,d(a){a&&(c(e),c(n),c(t))}}}function x(s,e,i){let{data:n}=e;return s.$$set=t=>{"data"in t&&i(0,n=t.data)},[n]}class S extends v{constructor(e){super(),b(this,e,x,I,f,{data:0})}}export{S as component,P as universal};
